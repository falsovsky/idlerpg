# Configuration file for IRPG bot. Prefix comments with a #. Line must start
# with a # to be a comment (no leading spaces and no comments starting in the
# middle of a line).

# If you don't personally know your admins, or you're just not the trusting
# type, you may want to look at the owneraddonly, and ownerdelonly options. 
# owneraddonly prevents non-owner accounts from assigning admin status to
# users. ownerdelonly prevents non-owner accounts from removing admin status
# from users

# Command line options override options in this file.

# this is what the bot considers to be an "internal clock" of sorts. some

# the players move on the map (self_clock times to simulate movement every
# second); HOGs, calamities, godsends, etc. are given a chance to occur
# every self_clock seconds; and the list goes on. if you have problems with
# the bot flooding off, try increasing this number to 4 or 5. if your bot
# appears to 'lag' because it is queueing too much text, you can set this
# as low as 1. this must be an integral value (no fractions), and it must be a
# factor of 60 (or certain events will not occur, like database rewrites)
